Emotion Recognition in Natural Social Interactions: Predicting Pleasantness from Facial Expressions and Body Touch in Movie Scenes

Overview：
This project develops a deep learning-based multimodal system for recognising emotions in naturalistic social interactions. The focus is on predicting the pleasantness of interactions in film scenes, by analysing facial expressions and body movements.
To simulate rich emotional contexts, the dataset is constructed from the TV series Modern Family, which provides diverse interpersonal behaviours such as hugs, pats, hand-holding, and expressive facial cues.

Research Goals：
1.Build a model that predicts the pleasantness of social interactions in cinematic content.
2.Examine the interaction between facial expressions and physical touch in shaping perceived emotions.
3.Compare unimodal vs. multimodal approaches to assess the added value of feature fusion.
4.Relate findings to social perception mechanisms in naturalistic viewing contexts.

Research Questions：
Can deep learning models accurately predict the pleasantness of social interactions based on visual representations of faces and touch in film scenes?
How do different modalities (facial features, touch gestures) interact, and does multimodal fusion improve recognition accuracy?
